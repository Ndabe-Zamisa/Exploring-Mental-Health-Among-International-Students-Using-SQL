# Exploring-Mental-Health-Among-International-Students-Using-SQL
# 🧠 Analyzing Students' Mental Health – DataCamp Datalab Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores how studying abroad affects the **mental health** of university students, based on a dataset from a **2018 survey** conducted at a Japanese international university. The aim is to identify key factors associated with depression among international students, including **social connectedness**, **acculturative stress**, and **length of stay**.

The analysis was conducted in **DataCamp Datalab** using **PostgreSQL**.

## 🎯 Research Questions

- Do international students experience more mental health challenges than domestic students?
- Does the **length of stay** in the host country influence mental health?
- Are **language proficiency**, **social connectedness**, and **acculturative stress** predictive of depression?

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

| Column Name     | Description                                            |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `inter_dom`     | Student type (International or Domestic)              |
| `japanese_cate` | Japanese language proficiency                         |
| `english_cate`  | English language proficiency                          |
| `academic`      | Current academic level (Undergraduate or Graduate)    |
| `age`           | Current age of the student                            |
| `stay`          | Length of stay in years                               |
| `todep`         | Total depression score (PHQ-9)                        |
| `tosc`          | Social connectedness score (SCS test)                |
| `toas`          | Acculturative stress score (ASISS test)              |

## 🧪 Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL** for data querying and analysis
- **DataCamp Datalab** as the notebook environment

## 🧠 Key Insights

- International students are at **higher risk of depression** compared to domestic students.
- **Low social connectedness** and **high acculturative stress** significantly correlate with higher depression scores.
- A **longer stay** may mitigate or worsen mental health symptoms, depending on other variables.
